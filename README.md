# LaserficheZipFilePOC
Proof of concept code for using a Laserfiche Workflow with an SDK Script to download Image PDF files that contain digital annotation stamps that are not part of the electronic document. Once all of the files are downloaded into a folder, a zip file is created of the folder containing all of the downloaded PDF files.
